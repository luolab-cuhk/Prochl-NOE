The raw data and results of our dating analysis with different molecular datasets are collected in the file "T30.tar.gz", "T40.tar.gz", "T40r1.tar.gz" and "T40r2.tar.gz". 

*Note that the codes "T40r1" and "T40r2" refer to the datasets "T40*" and "T40**" in the manuscript. 

*Note that the MCMC chain file was not included in the datasets due to the very large file size. These files are available upon request. 

The raw data and results of Fig2a and Fig2b are collected in the file "drdc_Proch_LCA.tar.gz" and "drdc_SBE_LCA.tar.gz", respectively.
